_ is our submission to SheHacks 2025! Inspired by the increasing isolation caused by social media, AI, and chatbots, we decided to use these technologies to instead help individuals improve their communication skills.

Users can choose their desired setting (professional, casual, or romantic) and their desired level. Immersed in an VR world, they are given a question to answer. The user then speaks their response aloud, allowing for a seamless, reality-like experience. Then, they are given a score and feedback about their response.

Our tech stack includes Python, OpenAI API, a Python text-to-speech library, and a Unity frontend.
